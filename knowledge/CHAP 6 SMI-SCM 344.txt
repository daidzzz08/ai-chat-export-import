Dimensions of Material Handling • Movement: Efficient movement of goods into and out of storage facilities. • Time: Readying goods for production or for customer order filling. • Quantity: Material-handling systems ensure the correct quantity of products meets production and customer needs despite varying usage and delivery rates. • Space: Utilising effectively limited space by the material-handling equipment in the warehouse and plant.
6.3 MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEMS Material handling can be manual or automated. Manual handling involves lifting, lowering, filling, emptying, or carrying containers, with ergonomic improvements reducing injury risks. Automated handling reduces or replaces manual efforts, often requiring human operators for tasks like loading and unloading. Advances in machine intelligence and robotics are increasing the use of automated handling.
All the material handling equipment in the facility is required to be a single unified system based on the following principles:
a. Planning: Involves creating a comprehensive plan that includes suppliers, consultants, finance, engineering, management, and operations components. b. Unitization: Assembling goods into a single compact load. c. Systems: Integrating handling and storage activities in a cost-effective manner. d. Simplification: Maximizing productivity by reducing, eliminating, and combining unnecessary movements and equipment. e. Ergonomics: Considering human limitations in human-mechanical systems.
a. Standardization: Standardizing material handling methods enables equipment and controls to perform various tasks rather than a specific one. b. Space Utilization: Ensuring effective use of space and keeping areas organized and clutter-free within the facility. c. Automation: Implementing automated technology in material handling, production, and storage. d. Environment: Designing systems to ensure reusability, recyclability, and environmental friendliness. e. Safety Principle: Providing safe methods for handling equipment and adhering to safety codes.
The primary objective of a material handling system is to reduce the unit cost of production. Additional objectives include:
a. Reducing manufacturing cycle time b. Minimizing delays and damage c. Promoting safety and improving working conditions d. Maintaining or improving product quality | a. Enhancing productivity through: | • Material flow in a straight line | • Material movement in as short a distance as possible | • Material movement at one time b. Material handling automation c. Controlling inventory
6.4 MATERIAL HANDLING EQUIPMENT Industrial material handling equipment includes a wide range of tools, vehicles, storage units, appliances, and accessories used for transporting, storing, controlling, enumerating, and protecting products throughout manufacturing, distribution, consumption, or disposal.
Grouped in 4 categories:
Storage Equipment: These are usually non-automated systems used to hold or handle reserve materials (buffer). They include:
• Racks: Such as pallet racks, push-back racks, and sliding racks, which save floor space while keeping contents accessible. • Stacking Frames: Stackable like blocks, allowing inventory, such as as containers of liquid, to be stacked without damage. • Shelves: Used with bins and drawers to store and organize smaller and more difficult-to-manage materials and products. • Mezzanines: Indoor platforms that create additional floor space.
Engineered Systems: These units work cohesively, often being automated, to enable storage and transportation. They include:
• Conveyors: Devices that move material or people horizontally or vertically between fixed points. • Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs): Computer-operated trucks that transport loads along a predetermined path, using sensors to avoid obstacles. • Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (AS/RS): Large automated systems for placing and retrieving loads or materials, such as as shuttle systems that quickly locate and retrieve storage items.
• Industrial Trucks. Trucks can also be manual or powered. A stack truck can be used to stack items, while a non-stack truck is typically used for transportation and not for loading. These include: • Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) • Automated Electrified Monorail • Storing Transfer Vehicle Source: Mecalux.com
• Bulk Handling Equipment: These are used to move large quantities of material, either in loose bulk form or packaged. They include: • Conveyors: Various types for different bulk materials. • Stackers: Automated systems that pile bulk material onto stockpiles. • Reclaimers: Retrieve materials from stockpiles using bucket wheels or scrapers.
Bucket Elevators: Use buckets on a rotating chain or belt to carry material vertically. Grain Elevators: Tall structures for storing grain, with equipment to convey grain to the top. Hoppers: Funnel-shaped containers for transferring material between containers. Silos: Large storage structures for bulk materials, typically without equipment to convey material to the top.

6.5 PACKAGING PERSPECTIVE Packaging is the science, art, and technology of enclosing or protecting products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. It serves both consumer marketing and industrial logistics purposes.
Packaging involves the container in which the product reaches the end user and is integral to the product's presentation. Its aims include: • Product Identification • Product Protection • Product Promotion • Product Information • Product Communication
Food packaging ensures the protection of products from external influences and damage while providing consumers with essential information such as ingredients, nutritional details, cost, and expiry date. The key functions of packaging include attracting buyers' attention, protecting the goods inside, describing contents, explaining benefits, providing warranty and warnings, and indicating value, price, and uses.
Additionally, packaging is crucial in moving materials through various stages of the logistics management process. a. Assembly: Protects and holds components during production processes. b. Automation: Standardized trays or pans are used in automated systems to function efficiently. c. Transportation: Aggregates and protects loads as they move through the supply chain. d. Warehousing: Ensures protection of products during storage. e. Holding Order: Keeps stored products organized prior to their delivery.
Packaging offers several key benefits: a. Containment: Facilitates the secure movement of products and prevents damage or loss, especially for hazardous materials. b. Protection: Shields products from environmental effects like shock, moisture, dust, insects, and contamination, reducing security risks during shipment. c. Apportionment: Divides products into manageable quantities for consumer use, from industrial production to retail sizes. d. Unitization: Combines primary packages into secondary packages and further into pallets or containers, reducing handling frequency.
a. Convenience: Enables easy use of products with minimal effort from customers. b. Communication: Provides information on usage, transportation, recycling, or disposal through packages and labels. c. Marketing: Enhances product appeal through design and labels, influencing consumer purchasing decisions. d. Sustainability: Promotes reuse and recycling, with some packaging materials being biodegradable.
6.6 TYPES OF PACKAGING Packaging can be categorized by the type of product and its function, typically divided into: • Primary: Envelops and holds the product. • Secondary: External packaging. • Tertiary: Used for transit. The four common types of packaging are:
1. Containers are receptacles that hold, protect, and organize products during storage and transport, and come in forms like bags, barrels, drums, and cartons, made from materials such as as corrugated cardboard, metal, plastic, and HDPE.
2. Pallets: Made of wood, plastic, or metal, these provide a portable, rigid platform for unit loads, used for assembling, storing, stacking, and transporting goods.
3. Dunnage: Materials or devices used to secure and brace products during shipments, often used in large boxes due to varying product sizes.
4. Unitizers: Materials that hold several items together to form a complete load.
Packaging Material The selection of packaging materials-such as paper, plastics, wood, or cardboard-depends on factors like product characteristics, transportation and storage methods, climate, standards, environmental considerations, and market position. For example, garments and textiles may use simple polyethylene bags, while glassware and delicate items require sturdy cardboard boxes for protection. Expensive products and gifts, like jewelry, often necessitate high-quality, costly packaging to ensure presentation and security.
Kinds of Packaging Packaging materials are categorized based on their use:
1. Plastic Packaging: Commonly uses polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).
2. Paper-Based Packaging: Includes wrapping, paperboard cartons, and corrugated fiberboard boxes.
3. Paperboard Cans: Inexpensive retail packaging lined with aluminum or plastic for added protection.
4. Combined Plastic and Cardboard Packaging: Uses both materials, often seen in retail for pens and gifts.
Kinds of Packaging
1. Plastic Boxes: Flexible, lightweight, recyclable, and durable, often used for food and showcasing products. Several traditional materials, such as wood, leather, glass, and ceramic are being replaced by plastic.
2. Sturdy Boxes: Made from thicker, more expensive paperboard for enhanced durability.
3. Foil-Sealed Bags: Used for food and other products to prevent spoilage and maintain quality.
4. Other Materials: Includes wood, textiles, straw, and locally available materials for specialized packaging like traditional ceramics and gift items.
Disposal of Packaging Waste Excessive packaging, often with multiple layers, raises concerns about cost, disposal, and its contribution to solid waste. While industrial packaging is more likely to be reused and recycled, consumer packaging frequently ends up as litter, creating significant environmental and health hazards. In India, discarded plastic waste clutters roads and rivers, poses health risks due to pollution, and endangers animals that ingest it.
Additionally, the non-disposable nature of materials like glass, plastic, and tin exacerbates the disposal problem.
Disposal of packaging The disposal of packaging waste can be addressed through several strategies:
• Prevention: Avoid using packaging materials, when possible, similar to carrying reusable bags for groceries. • Minimization: Reduce excessive packaging layers and use packaging only when necessary. • Reuse: Encourage the reuse of packaging materials by collecting them back from customers. • Recycling: Reprocess materials like steel, aluminum, glass, paper, and plastic for future use. • Disposal: Properly dispose of non-recyclable packaging through methods like incineration, landfill, or composting, ensuring that materials are non-hazardous and non-toxic.
To find out According to a 2018 TERI report, plastic constitutes 8% of India's total solid waste, with 94% being recyclable materials like PET and PVC. While 80% of plastic waste is recycled by rag pickers, only 28.4% of non-recyclable waste is treated, leaving significant pollution in landfills and water bodies. Despite the development of biodegradable plastics and efforts to reduce single-use plastic, there is still a pressing need for awareness and innovative alternatives to manage the plastic waste crisis effectively.
6.7 CONCLUSION Material handling and packaging are crucial elements of logistics management. They ensure the safe handling and protection of products during transit and provide essential identification beyond the product's appearance. This unit covers key aspects of these activities, highlighting their importance in logistics.
